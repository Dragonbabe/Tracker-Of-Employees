## Known Bugs
_The table join is not working. I was working on that and I just couldm't quite get that syntax down to get it to work. Also I was doing all my testing in the application itself and it seemed at some point it said that I had made requests too many times :smile: So! In using this application you may run into that error. It is a known bug and the development team is working to have it sorted out ASAP._

## Technologies Used
_This application used many different pieces and tied them all together! Started with MYSQL creating a database, and then referencing that in my JavaScript file. I used asychronous functions which was very exciting. I mean seriously. Does it get any more exciting than that?_
